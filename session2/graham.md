## The unbearable lightness of ... some things

---

### The weight of things

---

What weights more, a kilogram of feathers or a kilogram of iron?

---

What weights more, a charged battery or an empty one?

Does energy weight? ðŸ‘‹ {.fragment .fade-up}

---

$$
E = mc^2
$$

---

Does information weight?

It does! {.fragment .fade-up}

On average, one bit of data adds about $10^{-26}$ milligrams in weight ([Source: Padilla](https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1062276940)). {.fragment .fade-up}

The estimated Global Datasphere in (2018) was 33 Zettabytes ([Source: Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datasphere)).

$$
(33\cdot 10^{21} \text{bytes})(10^{-26} \frac{\text{mg}}{\text{bytes}}) = 0.0033 \text{mg}
$$

* 42 zettabytes: all the human speech ever spoken if digitized as 16-kilohertz 16-bit audio.
* 500 zettabytes: the information needed to completely describe the state a gram of water at room temperature.
* $1.364\times 10^{66}$ bits: the amount of information in a black hole whose mass equals that of the Earth [Source: Baez, UCR](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information.html#:~:text=1.364%20%C3%97%201066%20bits,1%20square%20meter%20in%20area.)

### Think of a number

What the largest number you can think of? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

How many bits do you need to represent it ? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

How heavier would your head become? {.fragment .fade-in}

#### How are big numbers represented anyhow?

---

* Repeated addition is multiplication $a\times b = \underbrace{a+a+a\cdots+a}_{b \text{ repetitions}}$ {.fragment .fade-up}

* Repeated multiplication is exponentiation $a^{b} = a \uparrow b =  \underbrace{a\times a\times a\cdots \times a}_{b \text{ repetitions}}$ {.fragment .fade-up}

* Repeated exponentiation is *tetration* $a\uparrow \uparrow b = {^{b}a} = \underbrace{a\uparrow (a \uparrow (\cdots \uparrow a))}_{b \text{ repetitions}}$ {.fragment .fade-up}

---

* $3 \uparrow \uparrow 3 = {^{3}3} = 3^{27} = 7,625,597,484,987$ {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* $3\uparrow \uparrow 4 = {^{4}3} = 3^{7,625,597,484,987}$ {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* $3\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3  = 3 \uparrow \uparrow (3 \uparrow \uparrow 3) =  3 \uparrow \uparrow 7,625,597,484,987$ {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

#### Which is the largest number?

---

---

#### [Graham's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number)


* $g_{1} = 3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3$

* $g_{2} = \underbrace{3 \uparrow \cdots \uparrow 3}_{ g_1 \text{ repetitions}}$
* $g_{3} = \underbrace{3 \uparrow \cdots \uparrow 3}_{ g_2 \text{ repetitions}}$

* $\vdots$
* $g_{64}$ is finally Graham's number {.fragment .highlight-green}

---

What would happen if you try to learn or think of the decimal representation of Graham's number?

---

* Remember that information weights {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

* The ammount of bytes required to represent this number is so big that if you learn that number ...{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

* Your head would collapse into a black hole {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

* Apparently, there is a name for that: **"Black hole head death"** ðŸ¤¯{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
